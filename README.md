# Satellite-Image-Classification

A deep learning-based image classification system that analyzes satellite and aerial images to categorize land use patterns such as bridges, highways, industrial zones, and annual crops.  
Built using TensorFlow with **DenseNet** architecture to support urban planning, crisis management, infrastructure development, and ecological conservation.


## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Automate the classification of satellite images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- **Dataset:** VLEO Satellite Images (from Kaggle)
- **Architecture Used:** DenseNet


## Features

- Preprocessing of high-resolution satellite images  
- Transfer learning using DenseNet  
- Image classification into specific land use categories  
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy and loss metrics
